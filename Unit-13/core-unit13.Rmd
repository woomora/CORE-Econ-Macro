- How do we account for international transactions?
 e.g. foreign production is domestic consumption (imports); or domestic production is foreign consumption (exports)

- How do we incorporate government?

  - Treat it as another producer – public services are “bought” via taxes
  
--
  
  - Assume that cost of production captures the value added

## Components of GDP
]

--

$$GDP = Y = C + I + G + X – M$$
--

- **Consumption (C)**: Expenditure on consumer goods and services 

--

- **Investment (I)**: Expenditure on newly produced capital goods (incl. equipment, buildings, and inventories = unsold output) 

--

- **Government spending (G)**: Government expenditure on goods and services (excluding transfers to avoid double-counting)

--

- **Net exports (trade balance)** = **Exports (X)** minus **imports (M)**

--

| | US | Eurozone | China |
|-------------------------|
| Consumption (C)	| 68.4%	| 55.9%	| 37.3% |
| Government spending (G)	| 15.1%	| 21.1%	| 14.1% |
| Investment (I)	| 19.1%	| 19.5%	| 47.3% |

**Shock**: an unexpected event which causes GDP to fluctuate.

--

Two kinds of shocks:
--
 **Household shocks**

--
 and **Economy-wide shocks**.

--
 How to deal with them?

--

.pull-left[

**Household shocks**

1) **Self-insurance** – saving and borrowing. Other households are not involved. 

2) **Co-insurance** – support from social network or government.

This reflects that households prefer to **smooth their consumption**, and that they are (to a degree) **altruistic**.

]

--

.pull-right[

**Economy-wide shocks**

Co-insurance is less effective if the bad shock hits everyone at the same time.

But co-insurance is even more necessary.

In farming economies of the past that were based in volatile climates, people practised co-insurance based on **trust, reciprocity, and altruism**.

.center[
## Smoothing Consumption
]

```{r out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f13-10-c.png")

At this time income is low. The individual saves and repays the debt when older and earning more, and finally runs down savings after retirement, when income falls again.

## Smoothing Consumption
]

```{r out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f13-10-c.png")

**Consumption smoothing is a basic source of stabilisation in an economy.** They think about what might happen to their income in the future, and they save and borrow to smooth the bumps in income. This is self-insurance.

- The benefits of coordinating investment makes cycles self-reinforcing.

--

- Firms respond positively to the growth of demand in the economy. **This is why investment is more volatile than GDP.**

--

  - Government spending is less volatile than investment (does not depend on business confidence)
  
  - Exports depend on demand from other countries, so will fluctuate according to the business cycles of major export markets.

## Summary
]

--

1) Economic growth is not a smooth process – the economy goes through a business cycle

--

  - Households try to smooth their consumption over the business cycle (problem: credit constraints)
  - Investment is more volatile than GDP; the outcome of a self-reinforcing coordination game
  -  Inflation moves with the business cycle
  
--

2) System of national accounts to measure the economy

  - GDP = C + I + G + X – M
  - Measuring GDP as income, spending, production
