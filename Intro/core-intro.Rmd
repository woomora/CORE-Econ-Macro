## Again: What is Economics?
]

- **How we come to acquire the things that make up our livelihood**: Things like food, clothing, shelter, or free time.

- **How we interact with each other**: Either as buyers and sellers, employees or employers, citizens and public officials, parents, children and other family members.

- **How we interact with our natural environment**: From breathing, to extracting raw materials from the earth.

- **How each of these changes over time.**

## What is (Macro)Economics?
]

.center2[

#### Economics:

> *The study of how people interact with each other and with their natural surroundings in producing their livelihoods, and how this changes over time*

#### Macroeconomics:

> *concerned with the aggregate sum of spending decisions of [...] groups, and the consequences of those decisions for economy—wide outcomes such as the rate of unemployment or inflation* 
(Carlin and Soskice)

# (Philosophical note)
]

  - Everyone has their political or economic ideals!
    - Even economist. We are humans and social beings.
    - We can agree on a benchmark or minumum of acceptable ideas (i.e. as long as they respect human rights)

### What is $\neq$ What is ought to be
*John Neville Keynes*
]

.center[
### La historia, como la lucha entre el bien y el mal en la que, por definición, los buenos somos nosotros
*Mauricio Tenorio Trillo*
]

  - Difficult to argue on *scientific neutrality*. 
  We should advance towards accepting both the rigorous evidence that we like and dislike.

# This class
]

--

  - What we are going to do in this (and the following) classes?
  
--

  - Study concepts and models used to understand aggregate behavior in the short, medium, and long-run.

--
    - Gonna use a lot of things from Micro (including a couple of chapters)

--

  - Ideally: See how economics is useful to provide answers to real world situations (big picture).

--

  - **Spoiler**: We will only have a better understanding. Unfortunately, we would not be able to fully know what happen, is happening, or will happen. But that's because there is uncertainty and we are humans `r emo::ji("smile")`

## Course Policies
]

- Be nice to each other `r emo::ji("smiling face with smiling eyes")`

- No harassment to any person or of any kind will be tolerated.

- Computers allowed. No cellphones.

- Attendance is mandatory, and it may influence the professor’s benevolence `r emo::ji("winking face")`

- You have enough time for your assignments, so late assignments are penalized. One point by each hour after deadline. 

- Academic integrity and honesty: cite other peoples’ ideas and work.

--

- **NEW**: If there is not an adequate environment in the classroom to teach (i.e. too much noise from individual conversations), I’ll stop the class and I’ll consider the subject as finished.

- **NEW**: If a student arrives late from class breaks, will be penalized with 0.1 from its final
grade.
