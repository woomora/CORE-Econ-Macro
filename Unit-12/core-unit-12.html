## The context for this Unit
]

Looked at behaviour of buyers and sellers under different market conditions, and conditions under which the competitive equilibrium is Pareto efficient.

&lt;img src="imgs/f8-9d.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

In reality, markets may allocate resources in a Pareto-inefficient way (market failure).
- What are the sources of these inefficiencies?
- How can governments solve the problem?

---

.center[
## Why do markets fail?
]

Conditions for markets to work well:

--

- **Private property** - the rights to the thing bought/sold 
- **Institutions** e.g. government - enforce property rights
- **Social norms** – respecting property rights
- Ability to write complete and enforceable contracts that can be evaluated in a court of law 

--

.center[
Markets fail when property rights are missing, incomplete, or are difficult to enforce with a contract.
]

--

.center[
## This Unit
]

--

1. Causes of market failure: External effects, asymmetric information, incomplete contracts

--

2. Possible solutions: Private bargaining, government policies

--

3. The limits of markets: should all goods be allocated via markets?

**External effect (externality)** = an effect of an economic decision that is not specified as a benefit or liability in the contract.

# Externalities: key concepts
]

- **Marginal private cost (MPC)** = marginal cost to decision-maker

- **Marginal external cost (MEC)** = costs imposed by decision-maker on society (fishermen)

- **Marginal social cost (MSC)** = MPC + MEC (full cost to society)

Pesticide in bananas' production:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-1a.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The purple line is the marginal cost for the growers: the **marginal private cost (MPC)** of banana production. It slopes upward because the cost of producing an additional tonne increases as the land is more intensively used, requiring more Weevokil.

---

Pesticide in bananas' production:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-1b.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The orange line shows the marginal cost imposed by the banana growers on fishermen—the **marginal external cost (MEC)**. This is the cost of the reduction in quantity and quality of fish caused by each additional tonne of bananas.

---

Pesticide in bananas' production:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-1c.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**MPC + MEC = MSC**

The green line in the diagram is the **marginal social cost (MSC)**. 


---

Pesticide in bananas' production:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-1d.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Total external cost: the sum of the differences between the marginal social cost and the marginal private cost at each level of production.

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-2.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If banana plantation owners want to maximize profits:

 `\(MC = P\)`

Then 80,000 tonnes maximizes profits for banana producers, **but this does not include the cost imposed on the fishing industry**

# Solutions
]

---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]

&lt;img src="https://i.imgflip.com/54hjww.jpg" width="35%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]


.pull-left[
&lt;img src="https://i.imgflip.com/54hjww.jpg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]


- Legally assign property rights to the externality (e.g. the right to pollute, the right to clean air)

--

- **In abscence of transaction costs**, Private bargaining between parties involved will result in a Pareto-efficient allocation regardless of which party has the property rights.

--

- In some situations, may be more effective than government intervention because private parties have more of the necessary information.

  
---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]

Pesticide is not illegal:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-4a.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The situation before bargaining is represented by point A, and the Pareto-efficient quantity of bananas is 38,000 tonnes. 

---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]

Pesticide is not illegal:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-4a.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The total shaded area shows the gain for fishermen if output is reduced from 80,000 to 38,000 (that is, the reduction in the fishermen’s costs or **reservation option**).

---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]

Pesticide is not illegal:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-4b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Reducing output from 80,000 to 38,000 tonnes reduces the profits of plantations. The lost profit is known as **minimum acceptable offer** equal to the loss of producer surplus, shown by the blue area.


---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]

Pesticide is not illegal:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-4c.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The net social gain is the gain for the fishermen minus the loss for the plantations, shown by the remaining green area.

---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]

An alternative legal framework: fishermen have the right to clean water.

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-4c.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Bargaining process would result in a Pareto-efficient allocation independently of whether the initial rights were granted to the plantations (right to pollute) or to the fishermen (right to unpolluted water)

---

.center[
## Solution #1: *Coasean* Bargaining
]

.center[
### Actual compensation depends on relative bargaining power
]

--

Practical limits of bargaining:

- **Limited funds** – fisherman may not have enough money to pay plantations the compensation required.

--

- **Impediments to collective action** – finding a representative and agreeing on how to split the gains within each party

--

- **Missing information** – calculating the exact costs imposed on each fisherman and each plantation’s contribution to pollution.

--

- **Enforcement** – it may be difficult for a court to determine whether plantations have complied or not.

---

.center[
## Solution #2: Government policies
]

&lt;img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FXRgnimX0AIDFvP.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.center[
### Solution #2: Government policies
### Regulation of production
]

Cap at socially optimal amount

&lt;img src="https://i.imgflip.com/42k41q.png?a465216" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

May be difficult to determine and enforce the right quota for each polluter


---

.center[
### Solution #2: Government policies
### Pigouvian tax/subsidy
]

Tax/subsidy on firms generating negative/positive external effects, in order to correct an inefficient market outcome.

Note that the government is who recieves the payment.

&lt;img src="https://i.imgflip.com/4yo1ob.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.center[
### Solution #2: Government policies
### Pigouvian tax/subsidy
]

At the Pareto-efficient quantity, 38,000 tonnes, the MPC is 295. The MSC is 400. So the marginal external cost is MSC – MPC = 105.

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-5a.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.center[
### Solution #2: Government policies
### Pigouvian tax/subsidy
]

If the government puts a tax (= MSC-MPC) on each tonne of bananas produced equal to 105, the marginal external cost, then the after-tax price received by plantations will be 295.

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-5b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

.center[
### Solution #2: Government policies
### Pigouvian tax/subsidy
]

To maximize profit, the plantations will choose their output so that the MPC is equal to the after-tax price. They will choose point `\(P_1\)` and produce 38,000 tonnes.


&lt;img src="imgs/f12-5c.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

.center[
### Solution #2: Government policies
### Compensation
]

Enforcing compensation for affected parties. The compensation required for each tonne of bananas will be equal to the difference between the MSC and the MPC:

&lt;img src="imgs/f12-6.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Similar to the effect of the tax, but the fishermen do better because they receive payment.

---

.center[
## Solution #2: Government policies
]

Practical limits of goverment policies:

- **Missing information** – government may not know the exact compensation needed to correct the problem.

--

- **Measurement** – Marginal social costs are difficult to measure.

--

- **Lobbying** - The government may favour the more powerful group, in which case it could impose a Pareto-efficient outcome that is unfair.

---
.center[
## Why do externalities occur?
]

--

External costs cause market failure due to **incomplete contracts**.

--

- Incomplete contracts do not specify, in an enforceable way, every aspect of the exchange that affects the interests of all affected parties (Units 6 &amp; 9).

--

- Contracts that include external costs/benefits are not enforceable because the relevant information is not **verifiable** or **asymmetric** (not known by decision-maker).

--

- Therefore, in reality it is impossible to use contracts or property rights so that all social costs/benefits are included in the decision-making process.

---

.center[
## 1) Public goods
]


.center[
Markets typically allocate private goods.

But for the other 3 types, markets are not possible or likely to fail.
]

--

- Non-rival goods have a marginal cost of zero, so it is not possible to set price = MC unless provision is subsidised.

--

- It is impossible to set a price for non-excludable goods because the provider cannot exclude those who haven’t paid.

--

.center[
Two forms of asymmetric information:
]

.pull-left[
1. **Hidden action** – leads to a **moral hazard** problem 

*Example* – Involuntary unemployment because employers cannot observe employees’ exact work effort (Unit 6).
]

.pull-right[
2. **Hidden attributes** – leads to an **adverse selection** problem

*Example* – Buyers of second-hand cars do not know all the attributes of the car e.g. quality, but the sellers do.

.center[
## 2) Asymmetric information

### Example #1: Health insurance
]

.pull-left[

Insurance companies cannot observe the health of the people buying insurance.

Purchasers know their health status. The less healthy are more likely to buy.

- To be profitable, the company must charge prices high enough and only the less healthy people are willing to buy.

- This adverse selection means that most people buying insurance already know they have a health problem.

- There is a missing market: many (healthier) people who would like to buy insurance will remain uninsured.

&lt;img src="https://www.expatica.com/app/uploads/sites/5/2020/01/car-insurance-france.jpg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[

Any form of insurance also has a hidden action problem – the buyer may take more risks now that he/she is insured. 

Example – purchasing full coverage against damage may make someone more careless in driving.

- Insurance companies can put some limits in a contract, but cannot enforce other types of behaviour e.g. driving speed. 

- This moral hazard problem is another principal-agent problem, and we can also think of it in terms of external effects (being careful gives external benefits to the company)

]

---

.center[
## 2) Asymmetric information

### Example #3: The banking system
]

.pull-left[

Borrowing and lending is another principal-agent problem in which the borrower’s decisions have external effects on the lender.

- Poor borrowers are often credit-constrained or credit-excluded, which is a form of credit market failure (Unit 10).


Another form of credit market failure is the banks themselves:

- If they take risks and go bankrupt, other banks (whom they have
borrowed from) will bear some of the costs.

- Governments will also bail out banks that are ‘too big to fail’, which incentivizes risk-taking behaviour.

]

---

.center[
## 3) Price &gt; MC
]

Firms may set price above marginal cost because of:

- Limited competition e.g. selling differentiated product 
- Decreasing long-run average costs due to economies of scale e.g. natural monopoly
- Deadweight loss can be eliminated via price discrimination (allocation ‘unfair’ because firms capture entire surplus) or competition policy.

.center[
# Should markets allocate everything?
]

Most likely not:

- **Repugnant markets**: creating a market for certain goods/services would violate ethical/social norms e.g. slavery

- Other institutions may be more effective e.g. governments, families

- Market mechanisms may **crowd out norms of social preferences** 

- **Merit goods**: goods that should be available to everyone, independently of their ability to pay e.g. education

.center[
# Summary
]

--

1) Sources of market failure
  - External costs or benefits
  - Asymmetric information (hidden action/hidden attributes)
  - Limited competition (P &gt; MC)

--

2) Possible solutions – regulation, taxation, compensation

--

3) Markets for other types of goods

  - Public goods and public ‘bads’
  - Limits to markets – not every good should have a market
