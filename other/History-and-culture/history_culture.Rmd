# What explain modern economic differences?

--

- The best predictor of a region’s relative
income in a period is its income in the years
prior

--

- The richest countries in the
world are about 42 times as rich as the poorest


--

- We have studied mainly short- and medium-run changes that explain differences in economic growth

--

- We underlined modern technology and policy

--

> **The causes of the wealth and poverty of nations [were] the grand object of all enquiries in Political Economy** (Thomas Malthus to David Ricardo)

--

> **An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations** (Adam Smith)

.pull-left[

## Development economics

- Studies the economic conditions of people in less-developed countries
- The sources of poverty have been hypothesized to lie in low levels of investments in land, machines, education, or health
- Ahistorical

]


.pull-right[

## Economic history

- Focus on important but historically specific
questions
- Connections between disparate time periods were infrequently made

]

--

.center[
## Historical and cultural economics
]

- Focus on historical events shaping contemporary outcomes

  - Institutions
  - Geography
  - Culture
  
- Explore hypothesis of historians, anthropologist, or sociologist.

- Extensive evidence on what mechanisms explain such persistence

## How does colonial ethno-racial institutions shape economic differences?

--

- Colonial segregation policies: *Pueblos de Indios*

--

- Focus on one city: Guadalajara, Mexico. Division between *Pueblos de Indios* and Spaniard settlement by a creek

## Mechanisms

- Cultural stigmatization towards those who live in the segregated side 

> ‘It is far away: on the other side of the Calzada’
> ‘There is nothing there’
> ‘It is people who do not pay taxes. How do they want to be taken into account by the government?’ 
(Jaramillo and Saucedo 2016)

```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/gdl_mechanisms.png")
```

---
## Policy proposal

--

### Heavy investment in public goods in the segregated side

--

Why it is relevant?

- Try to counter historical persistence
- Bring more economic opportunities to those who 'loose' in the birth lottery

--

How?

1. Investment in public transport
2. Investment in public goods (parks, plazas, public markets)
3. Financed it through taxes to the richest households who live in the non-segregated side (*tax foncière*)

--
## Research question proposal

Does this phenomena happens in other Mexican cities?
