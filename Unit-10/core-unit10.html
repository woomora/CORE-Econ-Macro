## The context for this Unit
]

Markets for goods and services allow parties to interact in mutually beneficial ways.

--

In most markets, money is the medium of exchange.

- How do banks create money?

- How do banking systems affect individual consumption choices and economic outcomes?

- What are the limitations of the banking system?

--
.center[
## This Unit
]

- Model how individuals borrow, save, and invest

- Understand the role of commercial banks and the central bank in the economy

- Explain how banks make money and the risks they face and pose

## Money
]

**Money**: A medium of exchange used to purchase goods or services.

&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/j3x5hjUoXIesM/giphy.gif" width="30%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
 
bank notes, bank deposits, cheques, coins, ...

--

- allows purchasing power to be transferred among people.

--

- there must be **trust** that others will accept your money as payment.

--

- time is essential: money allows **shifting consumption and production over time**.

--

Governments and banks usually provide this trust.

.center[
## Consumption over time
]


Trade-off between consuming goods now and later: **opportunity cost** of having more goods now is having fewer goods later.

--

Borrowing and lending allow us to rearrange our capacity to buy goods and services across time.

--

**Repayment**: principal + interest.

--

**Interest rate (r)**: The price of bringing some buying power forward in time. `\(r = \frac{repaument}{principal} - 1\)` 

--

**(1+r)**: Tradeoff between current and future consumption (MRT)

--

.center[
Example: Julia, principal = 91 and repayment = 100
]


.pull-left[

`$$repayment = 91 + 91\cdot r = 91 \cdot (1 + r) \approx 100$$`
]

.pull-right[

`$$r = \frac{100}{91} - 1  \approx 1.10 - 1 = .10 = 10\%$$`
]

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-a.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia does not have money now, but knows that in the next period (later) she will have $100 from her paycheck or harvest.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia could borrow 91 now and promise to pay the lender the 100 that she will have later. The interest rate would be 10%.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-b.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia could borrow 91 now and promise to pay the lender the 100 that she will have later. The interest rate would be 10%.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-c.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At the same interest rate (10%), she could also borrow 70 to spend now, and repay 77 at the end of the year. In that case she would have 23 to spend next year.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-d.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

She could also borrow 30 to spend now, and repay 33 at the end of the year. In that case she would have 67 to spend next year.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-e.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The boundary of Julia’s feasible set is her feasible frontier, shown for the interest rate of 10%.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-f.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Juila can borrow now and choose any combination on her feasible frontier.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-g.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If, instead of 10%, the interest rate is 78%, Julia can only borrow a maximum of $56 now.

---

.center[
### Borrowing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-2-h.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The feasible set with the interest rate of 78% is the dark shaded area, while the feasible set with an interest rate of 10% is the dark shaded area plus the light shaded area.

---

.center[
### Preferences for consumption
]

What would you do?
--
 How much consumption we bring forward depends on how impatient we are.

&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lHBbcpFTS5c2Y/giphy.gif" width="27%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

How much consumption an individual will bring forward depends on:  

--

- **consumption smoothing**: changing consumption across time (consuming a lot in one period and little in the other).
- **impatience**
  - **Myopia (short-sightedness)**: People experience the present satisfaction more strongly than the same satisfaction later
  - **Prudence**: People know that they may not be around in the future, and so they want to consume now
  
--

**Diminishing marginal returns to consumption**  the value to the individual of an additional unit of consumption in a given period declines the more that is consumed.

---

.center[
## Consumption smoothing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-a.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The dashed line shows the combinations of consumption now and consumption later from which Julia can choose.

---
.center[
## Consumption smoothing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-b.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia’s IC is bowed toward the origin as a consequence of diminishing marginal returns to consumption in each period: the more goods she has in the present, the less she values an additional one now relative to more in the future. 

---
.center[
## Consumption smoothing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-c.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The MRS at C is high (the slope of her indifference curve is steep): Julia has little consumption now and a lot later, so diminishing marginal returns mean that she would like to move some consumption to the present.

---

.center[
## Consumption smoothing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-c.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The MRS at E is low: She has a lot of consumption now and less later, so diminishing marginal returns mean that she would like to move some consumption to the future.

---

.center[
## Consumption smoothing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-d.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

MRS is falling as we move along the indifference curve from C to E: the slope is steeper at C than at E.

---

.center[
## Consumption smoothing
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-3-e.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia will choose point F. It is on the highest attainable indifference curve. She prefers to smooth consumption between now and later.

---
.center[
## Optimal decision-making
]

--

**Discount rate** `\((\rho)\)`: a measure of a person's impatience.

--
  - Consumption smoothing
  - Pure impatience 
  
--

Individual borrows at the point where discount rate = interest rate

--

$$ \textit{slope of the indifference curve (MRS)} = \textit{slope of the feasible frontier (MRT)}$$

--

.pull-left[
`$$MRS = 1 + \rho$$`
]

.pull-right[
`$$MRT = 1 + r$$`
]

--

$$ MRS = MRT \iff 1 + \rho = 1 + r \iff \rho = r $$

---

.center[
### Optimal decision-making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-a.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Julia wishes to get to the highest indifference curve but is limited by her feasible frontier.

---

.center[
### Optimal decision-making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-b.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When the interest rate is 10%, the highest attainable indifference curve will be the one that is tangent to the feasible frontier.

---

.center[
### Optimal decision-making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-c.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Point E: MRS = MRT.

---

.center[
### Optimal decision-making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-d.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At point F, her discount rate, `\(\rho\)`, exceeds `\(r\)`, the interest rate, so she would like to bring consumption forward in time. 

---

.center[
### Optimal decision-making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-e.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If the interest rate at which she can borrow increases, the feasible set gets smaller.

---
.center[
### Optimal decision-making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-4-f.png" width="52.25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The best Julia can do now is to borrow less (35 instead of 58), as shown by point G.


---
.center[
## Borrowers and savers
]

Think that instead of having 100 in the next period, you have 100 in this period.
--
  Instead of borrowing, lending.

.pull-left[

**Reservation indifference curve**: all of the points at which the individual would be just as well off as at the reservation position (endowment).

The borrower and the saver have different indifference curves because they have **different endowments.**

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-6-a.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Marco has $100 of grain available now.

---

.center[
## Saving and lending
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-6-b.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

There is a 20% depreciation for next period. The dark line shows Marco’s feasible frontier using storage, and the shaded area shows his feasible set.

---

.center[
## Saving and lending
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-6-c.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Marco’s reservation indifference curve goes through his endowment.

---

.center[
## Saving and lending
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-6-d.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Point H on Marco’s indifference curve denotes the amount of storage that he will choose.

---

.center[
## Saving and lending
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-6-e.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

A better plan would be to lend the money. The light line shows the feasible frontier when Marco lends at 10%.

---
.center[
## Saving and lending
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-6-f.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Marco is now able to reach a higher indifference curve.

---
.center[
## Investment
]

--

If Marco owns some land, he could do even better. 
--
 He could invest the grain. This opportunity to **invest** will **further expand his feasible set**.
 
--

&lt;img src="imgs/f10-7-a.png" width="48%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
.center[
## Investment
]

Suppose that if he were to invest all of his grain, he could harvest $150 worth of grain later
 
&lt;img src="imgs/f10-7-a.png" width="48%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
.center[
## Investment
]

The slope of the red line is −1.5: the marginal rate of transformation of investment into returns, or 1 plus the rate of return on the investment.
 
&lt;img src="imgs/f10-7-b.png" width="48%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
.center[
## Investment
]

He has invested 100, harvested 150, and so earned a profit of 150 − 100 = 50, or a profit rate of 50%.
 
&lt;img src="imgs/f10-7-b.png" width="48%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
.center[
## Investment
]

Given such feasible set, he chooses his consumption: note he is able to consume more now and tomorrow.
 
&lt;img src="imgs/f10-7-c.png" width="48%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---
.center[
## Investment
]

Marco can do even better: invest everything he has, with a harvest next year of $150, but also get a loan at 10% now in order to be able to consume more both now and in the future.

--
 
&lt;img src="imgs/f10-8-a.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
.center[
## Investment
]

Marco invest everything he has, with a harvest next year of $150.
 
&lt;img src="imgs/f10-8-a.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
.center[
## Investment
]

If he could get a loan at 10%, he would be better off by investing everything he has. This expands his feasible set, as shown by the dotted red line.
 
&lt;img src="imgs/f10-8-b.png" width="45%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---
.center[

Marco ends up consuming at point L, with 80 now and 62 in the future.

### Summarizing so far
]

Borrowing, lending, storing, and investing, are ways of moving goods consumption forward (to the present) or backwards (to the future) in time.

--

People differ in which of these activities they engage (some borrowing, some lending) because:

--

- They have **differences in their situation:** For example, having an income now or later will affect their discount rates and their opportunities. Also, some have investment opportunities (like Marco), while others do not.

--

- They differ in their level of pure impatience.

--

&lt;img src="imgs/WIR2022.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Wealth is an important aspect in the process of borrowing, lending, and investing.

Those with more wealth like Marco have opportunities not available to those with less wealth, like Julia.

# Banks and Money
]

---
.center[
## Banks
]


--

A **bank** is a firm that makes profits by lending and borrowing.

--

Banks borrow from households (**deposits**), other banks, and the central bank. 

--

The interest they pay on deposits is lower than the interest they charge on loans, which is how banks make profits.

--

---
.center[
## Central Banks
]

--

**Base money/high-powered money**: notes and coins.
--
 Money as legal tender.
 
--

Legal tender has to be accepted as payment by law.

--

The central bank is the only bank that can create legal tender.

--

- the central bank is usually owned by the government. 
- acts as the banker for the commercial banks, who have accounts at the central bank that hold legal tender.
- by crediting these accounts, the central bank can create money.

## Types of money
]
--

-  **Base money:** Cash held by households, firms, and banks, and the balances held by commercial banks in their accounts at the central bank, known as reserves. Base money is the liability of the central bank.

--

- **Bank money:** Money in the form of bank deposits created by commercial banks when they extend credit to firms and households. Bank money is the liability of commercial banks.

- **Broad money:** The amount of broad money in the economy is measured by the stock of money in circulation. This is defined as the sum of bank money and the base money that is in the hands of the non-bank public.

--

$$ \textit{broad money} = \textit{base money} + \textit{bank money}

Example: Marco has $100 in cash and he puts it in a bank account in Abacus Bank.

Marco wants to pay $20 to his local grocer, Gino, in return for groceries, so he instructs Abacus Bank to transfer the money to Gino’s account in Bonus Bank.

Suppose that Gino borrows 100 from Bonus Bank. Bonus Bank lends him the money by crediting his bank account with 100, so he is now owed 120. But he owes a debt of 100 to the bank. So Bonus Bank’s balance sheet has expanded.

### Bonus Bank has now expanded the money supply: 

Gino can make payments up to 120, so in this sense the money supply has grown by $100—even though base money has not grown

Note that when Gino wants to spend his loan, his bank has to transfer base money.

In practice, banks make many transactions to one another in a given day, most cancelling each other out, and they settle up at the end of each day.

So at the end of each day, each bank will transfer or receive the net amount of transactions they have made. 

This means they do not need to have available the legal tender to cover all transactions or demand for cash.

Creating money may sound like an easy way to make profits.

But the money banks create is a liability, not an asset, because it has to be paid on demand to the borrower. 

It is the corresponding loan that is an asset for the bank.

Banks make profits out of this process by charging **interest** on the loans.

## Default risk and liquidity risk
]

Banks provide the service of:

--
.pull-left[

**maturity transformation**:

- deposits can be withdrawn at any time
- but loans only need to be repaid after a specified time

]

.pull-right[

**liquidity transformation**: 


- deposits are liquid 
- loans to borrowers are frozen (illiquid)

]

--

This exposes the bank to risks:

1. **Default risk**: loans are not repaid.
2. **Liquidity risk**: an asset cannot be exchanged for cash rapidly enough to prevent a financial loss.

## Banking crisis
]

.pull-left[

- Banks make money by lending much more than they hold in legal tender. 


- **Bank run**: situation when all depositors demand their money at once; may result in bank failure. 


- Banks can also fail by making bad investments, such as by **giving loans that do not get paid back**.

- The government may intervene, because unlike the failure of a firm, a **banking crisis can bring down the financial system**.

## The money market
]

Banks need enough base money to cover their net transactions.

--

They borrow base money on the money market at the short-term interest rate. 

- The demand for base money depends on how many transactions commercial banks have to make. 

- The supply of base money is a decision by the central bank.

`$$\textbf{net worth} = assets – liabilities$$`

The net worth of a bank is what is owed to the shareholders/ owners. It is also called **equity**.

Negative net worth means the bank is insolvent.

--

Leverage describes the reliance of a company on debt. 

$$leverage = \frac{\textit{total assets}}{\textit{net worth}}  $$

## Principal-agent problem
]

Lending is risky.

--

**Principal-agent problem**: 
a conflict of interest between principal and agent, about some hidden action or attribute of the agent that cannot be enforced or guaranteed in a binding contract.

--

Example: Financing a project. Lenders face the risk that money borrowed will not be repaid, but lack information about the project’s success or borrower’s effort so cannot ensure that the project succeeds. 
--

| | **Actors** | **Conflict of interest over** | **Enforceable contracts cover** | **Unenforceable** | **Result** |
| -------- |
| **Labour Market (Units 6 and 9)** | Employers  Employees | Wages, work (quality and amount) | Wages, time, conditions | Work (quality and amount), duration of employment | Effort under-provided; unemployment |
| **Credit market (Units 10 and 12)** |	Lender Borrower	| Interest rate, conduct of project (effort, prudence) | Interest rate |	Effort, prudence, repayment |	Too much risk, credit constraints |

---
.center[
## Equity and collateral
]

To resolve the conflict of interest between the principal (lender) and the agent (borrower):

--

- **Equity**: the lender may require the borrower to put some of her wealth into the project

--

- **Collateral**: the borrower has to set aside property that will be transferred to the lender if the loan is not repaid


&lt;img src="https://www.thebalancemoney.com/thmb/CU0os7YF6ZflW82NgC8He1kcdIo=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-77332452-5b324a6ac9e77c001ad9c077.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

## Credit rationing
]

Those with less wealth find it more difficult to provide equity or collateral. 

--

**Credit rationing**: when those with less wealth


- borrow on unfavourable terms compared with those with more wealth (**credit-constrained**)

--

- or are refused loans entirely (**credit-excluded**)

Example: 

An economy is composed of 90 farmers who borrow from 10 lenders. 

`\(i = \textit{share of lenders} = 0.10\)`

`\(\Pi = \textit{rate of profit} = 0.15\)`

`\(\Rightarrow\)` lenders’ share of total income is 2/3 and the borrowers’ is 1/3.
