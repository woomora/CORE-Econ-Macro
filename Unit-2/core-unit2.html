Nassau Senior consistently opposed British government famine relief

--

&gt; feared the famine of 1848 in Ireland would not kill more than a million people, and that would scarcely be enough to do much good.

# Techological change, Population, and Growth

--


- The capitalist and industrial revolution.

- Economic models.

- Explaining growth.

- Explaining stagnation.

--


### Technological progress

--

- How did the technological revolution start?
- Why did it not start earlier?
- Why did it started in England?

--

Use economic models to explain the rapid growth in real wages and population in the last 2 centuries, and the stagnation in the centuries before that.


---
## Key concepts in economic models

--

**Ceteris paribus** = simplification that involves "holding other things (in/outside the model) constant”. 

--

**Incentives** = economic rewards or punishments, which influence the benefits and costs of alternative courses of action.

--

**Relative prices** help us compare alternatives.

--

**Economic rent** = the benefit received from a choice, taking into account the next best alternative (reservation option)

$$ \textit{economic rent} = \textit{benefit from option taken}  -  \textit{benefit from next best option} $$ 

--

**Equilibrium of a model** = situation that is self-perpetuating. Something of interest does not change unless an external force is introduced that alters the model's description of the situation.


---
## Economic models: See more by looking at less

--

A useful model

--

- **It is clear**: it helps us better understand something important

--

- **It predicts accurately**: its predictions are consistent with evidence 

--

- **It improves communication**: it helps us to understand what we agree (and disagree) about 

--

- **It is useful**: We can use it to find ways to improve how the economy works

--

## Explaining grwoth: the Industrial Revolution

--

Why did the Industrial Revolution happen first in the 18th Century, on an island off the coast of Europe?

--

Many alternative explanations
--
 provided by historians, economic historians, and economists
--

- **Robert Allen**: relatively high cost of labour &amp; cheap local sources of energy

--

- **Joel Mokyr**: Europe’s scientific revolution and Enlightenment

--

- **David Landes**: political and cultural characteristics of nations as a whole

--

- **Gregory Clark**: cultural attributes such as hard work and savings

--

- **Kenneth Pomeranz**: abundance of coal and access to colonies

---

## Technology 

--

**Technology**: A process that uses inputs to produce an output.

--

Firms choose between technologies (specific combinations of inputs) to produce outputs.

---

Firms choose between technologies (specific combinations of inputs) to produce outputs.


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-04-b.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Technology A dominates the C-technology: the same amount of cloth can be produced using A with fewer inputs of labour and energy. This means that, whenever A is available, you would never use C.

---

Firms choose between technologies (specific combinations of inputs) to produce outputs.


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-04-c.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Technology B dominates the D-technology: the same amount of cloth can be produced using B with fewer inputs of labour and energy. Note that B would dominate any other technology that is in the shaded area above and to the right of point B.

---

Firms choose between technologies (specific combinations of inputs) to produce outputs.


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-04-d.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Technology A dominates C; technology B dominates D. The E-technology does not dominate any of the other available technologies. We know this because none of the other four technologies are in the area above and to the right of E.

---

## Firm’s choice: minimising cost 

--

Firms aim to maximise their profit,
--
 which means producing cloth at the least possible cost.
 
--

This is why the firms’ choice of technology depends on economic information about relative prices of inputs.

--

$$ cost = (wage \times workers ) + (\textit{price of a tonne of coal} \times \textit{number of tonnes of coal}) $$

--

$$ c = (w \times L ) + (p \times R) $$

--

$$ c = w L + p R $$

--
Then

--

$$ p R = c - w L $$

--

$$ R = \frac{c}{p} - \frac{w}{p} L $$
--

** `\(R\)` =  Isocost lines**: combinations of inputs that give the same cost (slope = relative price of inputs)

--

** `\(- \frac{w}{p}\)` **: slope `\(\rightarrow\)` **relative price of labour**

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne**
--
 `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)` 

--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-05-a.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

The total cost of employing 2 workers with 3 tonnes of coal is (2 × 10) + (3 × 20) = £80.

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)` 

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-05-b.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


If the number of workers is increased to 6, costing £60, and the input of coal is reduced to 1 tonne, the total cost will still be £80.

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)`


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-05-c.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


The straight line through P1 and P2 joins together all the points where the total cost is £80.

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)`


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-05-d.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


At point Q1 (3 workers, 6 tonnes of coal) the total cost is £150. 
In point Q2, if 2 more workers are employed, the input of coal should be reduced by 1 tonne to keep the cost at £150. This is the £150 isocost line.

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)`


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-05-e.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


If prices of inputs are fixed, the isocost lines are parallel. A simple way to draw any line is to find the end points: for example, the £80 line joins the points J (4 tonnes of coal and no workers) and H (8 workers, no coal).

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)`


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-05-f.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


The slope of the isocost lines is negative. In this case the slope is −0.5, because at each point, if you hired one more worker, costing £10, and reduced the amount of coal by 0.5 tonnes, saving £10.

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)`


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-05-g.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


Points above an isocost line cost more.

---

**Suppose that the wage is £10 and the price of coal is £20 per tonne** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{20} = .5\)`


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-06-d.svg" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


Which is the least-cost technology?

---

**Suppose that the price of coal falls to £5 while the wage remains at £10**
--
 `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{5} = 2\)`
 
--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-07-a.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

A-technology, which is more energy-intensive than the others, can produce 100 metres of cloth at a lower cost than B or E.

---

**Suppose that the price of coal falls to £5 while the wage remains at £10** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{5} = 2\)`
 

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-07-b.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


The A-technology is on the isocost line FG. At any point on this line, the total cost of inputs is £40. Technologies B and E are above this line, with higher costs.


---

**Suppose that the price of coal falls to £5 while the wage remains at £10** `\(\rightarrow \textit{Relative price}:  \frac{w}{p} = \frac{10}{5} = 2\)`
 

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-07-c.svg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


The slope of the isocost line is equal to −(10/5) = −2. If you spent £10 on labour by hiring an extra worker, you could reduce coal by 2 tonnes and keep the total cost at £40.

---

## How does a cost-reducing innovation raise the profits of the firm?

--

At the original relative price, B is the lower cost technology


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-08-a.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When the wage is £10 and the price of coal is relatively high at £20, the cost of producing 100 metres of cloth using technology B is £80: choosing the B-technology puts the firm on the HJ isocost curve.

---

## How does a cost-reducing innovation raise the profits of the firm?

The price of coal falls to £5

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-08-b.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If the price of coal falls relative to the wage as shown by the isocost curve FG, then using the A-technology, which is more energy-intensive than B, costs £40. From the table, we see that with these relative prices, A is now the least-cost technology.

---

## How does a cost-reducing innovation raise the profits of the firm?

B now costs more than A

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-08-c.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At the new relative prices, the B-technology is on the isocost line MN, where the cost is £50. Switching to technology A will be cheaper.

---


$$ profits = revenue - costs $$
--

Switching from A to B:

$$ \Delta profits =  \Delta revenue -  \Delta costs =  0 -  (40 - 50) = 10 $$

--

The economic rent for a firm switching from B to A is £10 per 100 metres of cloth, which is the cost reduction made possible by the new technology --**Schumpeterian (innovation) rents**--

--

Joseph Schumpeter: the adoption of technological improvements by **entrepreneurs** --first adopters-- a key part of his explanation for the dynamism of capitalism. 

--

**Creative Destruction**: the process by which old technologies and the firms that do not adapt are swept away by the new, because they cannot compete in the market.

## Technological change in Industrial Revolution

--

One of the first sectors to undergo technological change was textiles

--

- Before the Industrial Revolution, making clothes for the household were time-consuming tasks

--

- By the late 19th century, a single spinning mule operated by a very small number of people could replace more than 1,000 spinsters

--

- These machines were powered by water wheels and later coal-powered steam engines instead of using human labour

--


&lt;img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/04/Zeichnung_Spinning_jenny.jpg" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## Why Britian?

--

**Hypothesis**:
--
 When the cost of labour increased relative to the cost of energy, there were innovation rents to be earned from a switch to the energy-intensive technology.

]

.pull-right[
&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-11.svg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
]

--

The incentive to replace workers with machines was increasing in England during this time, but this was not true in France.

---
## Shift to a lower-cost technology

--

The combination of capacity to innovate and changing relative prices of inputs led to a switch to energy-intensive technology.

--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-12-a.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

In the 1600s, the relative prices are shown by isocost line HJ. The B-technology was used. At those relative prices, there was no incentive to develop a technology like A, which is outside the isocost line HJ.

---
## Shift to a lower-cost technology


The combination of capacity to innovate and changing relative prices of inputs led to a switch to energy-intensive technology.


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-12-b.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

In the 1700s, the isocost lines such as FG were much steeper, because the relative price of labour to coal was higher. The relative cost was sufficiently high to make the A-technology lower cost than the B-technology.

---

The combination of capacity to innovate and changing relative prices of inputs led to a switch to energy-intensive technology.


&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-12-c.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We know that when the relative price of labour is high, technology A is lower cost because the B-technology lies outside the isocost line FG.

## Diminishing average product of labour

--

Agricultural economy

--

**Factors of production**: labour and land

--

- production: one good, grain.
- only farm labour, working on the land.

--

**Ceteris paribus** assumption: that the amount of land is fixed and all of the same quality.

--

**Average productivity**

$$ \textit{average productivity of labour} = \frac{\textit{total output}}{\textit{total number of farmers}}  $$

--

**Production function**: relationship between the amount of output produced and the amounts of inputs used to produce it.

$$ Y = f(X) $$

Production function gives maximum output for a given set of inputs.

---
## Diminishing average product of labour

--

If we hold one input (land) fixed, and expand the other input (labour), the average output per worker is going to fall.

## Malthus argument

--

1. Population expands if living standards increase

2. Law of diminishing average product of labour implies that as more people work on the land, their income will inevitably fall

--

.pull-left[

In equilibrium, living standards will be forced down to subsistence level. 

Population and income will stay constant. 

Self-correcting response to new technology. In the long run, an increase in productivity will result in increased population but not increased wages.

## Modelling Malthus

--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-16-a.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At a medium population level, the wage of people who work the land is at subsistence level (point A). The wage is higher at point B, where the population is smaller, because the average product of labour is higher.

---
## Modelling Malthus

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-16-b.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When wages (on the vertical axis) are high, population growth (on the horizontal axis) is positive (so the population will rise). When wages are low, population growth is negative (population falls).

---
## Modelling Malthus

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-16-c.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At point A, on the left, population is medium-sized and the wage is at subsistence level. So if the economy is at point A, it is in equilibrium: population stays constant and wages remain at subsistence level.


---
## Modelling Malthus

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-16-d.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Suppose the economy is at B, with a higher wage and lower population. Point B′, on the right, shows that the population will be rising.

---
## Modelling Malthus

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-16-e.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

As the population rises, the economy moves down the line in the left diagram: wages fall until they reach equilibrium at A.

---
## Modelling Malthus: productivity increases

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-17-a.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The economy starts at point A, with a medium-sized population and wage at subsistence level.

---
## Modelling Malthus: productivity increases

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-17-b.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Technological improvement (better seeds) raises the average product of labour, and the wage is higher for any level of population. The real wage line shifts upward. At the initial population level, the wage increases and the economy moves to point D.

---
## Modelling Malthus: productivity increases

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-17-c.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At point D, the wage has risen above subsistence level and therefore the population starts to grow (point D′).

---
## Modelling Malthus: productivity increases

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-17-d.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

As population rises, the wage falls, due to the diminishing average product of labour. The economy moves down the real-wage curve from D.

---
## Modelling Malthus: productivity increases

&lt;img src="imgs/figure-02-17-e.svg" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At C, the wage has reached subsistence level again. The population remains constant (point C′). The population is higher at equilibrium C than it was at equilibrium A.

## Testing Malthus

--

1) Diminishing average product of labour 

--

2) Rising population in response to increases in wages

--

3) **An absence of improvements in technology to offset the diminishing average product of labour**

The permanent technological revolution meant that third condition no longer holds, and explains why Britain was able to escape the Malthusian trap.

### Summary

--

**1) Introduction to economic models**

- Less is more: use simplifying assumptions e.g. *ceteris paribus*

--

**2. Used models for insights on the technological revolution**

- Model of a firm: high wages (relative to capital, including energy) motivated technological innovation
- Malthus’ model: permanent technological change enabled economies to escape economic stagnation

--

### Next unit (23/03/2021)

--

- An economic model of decision making under constraints

- How individuals respond to technological change: Explaining trends in choices of working hours across time
